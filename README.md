# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Introduction to Python for Data Analysis

## Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data 

### Overview

This is the second project in Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems
in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to
compute descriptive statistics. I also will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help me visualize the data.

This project was my first exposure to the kinds of steps that a data analyst takes when they approach a dataset. The steps of the process that I went through here was covered in more depth as I continued on with the Nanodegree program.I had not seen some of the packages used in the project prior to this point, so that helped me in searching through documentation and experimenting with code to build my intuition for how to use the packages to solve the problems posed.

### Files

- Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb

This is the notebook where I performed main part of the project.

- data

Contains usage information of bikeshare system for three cities: Chicago, Washington, and NYC.

- examples

It contains samples which which worked as a guide when I did the data analysis process.
